# Welcome to my portfolio's touch up
This little project is to give my portfolio a much needed makeover. New features will be added over time and hopefully they will be of increasing skill and finesse. 

## What's going to change?
For the first few commits I'm going to be recreating all the pages I have on the old portfolio with a new look. A couple of new things might make their way into the final product too. In the not so distant future I'm going to be adding some projects I've been cooking up (One is in a art direction.... direction and the other is in the programming side of the web (finally).

## Don't be shy
If you spot something that's made it through my little net please don't hesitate to call me out on it, this could be anything. Think I could have coded something a little better?, more semantically? or an issue with accessibility? Add a comment, I'd love to learn what I can do to make myself a better developer.
