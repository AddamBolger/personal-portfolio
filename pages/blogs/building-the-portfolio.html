        <h1>Building my portfolio</h1>

        <div class="main-content">
            <div class="blog-paragraph">
                <p><span class="paragraph-one__dropcap"> T </span>here was quite a bit of effort in creating the 
                website you’re currently seeing despite how easy I’ve made it look. 
                Stemming from my personal preference of minimalist designs I decided to look into 
                the research behind the user’s experience of these sites. Looking at UX Planet 
                I saw that the idea is a growing trend. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="blog-paragraph">
                <p>
                The article recommends a series of things when trying to get the most of the 
                minimalist design such as using a simplistic colour scheme. Which as you can tell 
                from the site, it consists of 3 colours chosen for their contrasting properties, white 
                and black because you can’t get any more contrasting and the red because both colours 
                contrast well against it. This would be a good choice for people with colour deficiencies 
                as to make it easy to tell the difference between the different elements.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="blog-paragraph">
            <p>
            The article states that white space is also a key part of the minimalist design 
            forcing the eye to rest on the components. This has attempted to be implemented into the 
            portfolio where each element is given adequate space to allow the elements to be centre of attention. 
            This was also supported by Tubik Studio’s blog who said that white space is used to create elegance 
            in the site which is especially useful when used in monochromatic colour schemes. 
            </p>
            </div>


            <div class="blog-paragraph">
                <p>
                As shown below you can see what the landing section looked like when 
                I initially designed it.
                </p>

                <img src="blog-assets/Wireframe.png" alt="This is the first iteration of my wireframes of the site.">

                <p>Afterwards it has become the section you see today… minus the down arrow which will come later.</p>
            </div>
                   
           <div class="blog-paragraph">
                <p>
                After critique from one of my peers, one of the guests who came around 
                to give feedback on our projects, it was suggested that I use the leftmost edge 
                of the logo on the site to create a margin line, allowing user’s eyes to reset to 
                the same point on each section. 
                </p>
           </div>
            
            <div class="blog-paragraph">
                <p>
                I took this piece of advice on board and feel that such a small change 
                has already made a huge difference to the design and overall feel of the website which 
                I hope the audience feels when they go through the site.
                </p>
            </div>
            
           
               <div class="blog-paragraph">
                    <p>
                    When coding the website I had inclusivity in my mind for every element, 
                    meaning for all the pictures that had meaning to the site, had alt text. 
                    All links had titles and none of them were called: “Click here”, “Here” or “Read more”. 
                    This allows for screen readers to get all the information they need when skimming over 
                    the website via screen readers. Semantic markup and correct elements were assigned to 
                    according sections of the site for example only 1 h1 tag and there wasn’t a div with a 
                    class of “nav” instead just using the nav HTML5 tag.
                    </p>
               </div>
                
                <div class="blog-paragraph">
                    <p>
                    To improve the accessibility of the website I could include ARIA labels 
                    where applicable and check the site against those guidelines in order to make sure the 
                    site is completely inclusive.
                    </p>
                </div>
          
            
            <div class="blog-paragraph">
                <p>
                I have decided to launch the site on a custom domain in order to convey that I have 
                indeed gone out of my way to get my own web presence given that it is going to be my profession, 
                it was better to get my own domain that was easy to remember and promoted my brand of development.
                </p>
            </div>

           <div class="blog-paragraph">
                <p>
                This change is supported by the industry as it is heavily expected for a front-end developer 
                especially to have a custom domain for their portfolio and previous work to show potential 
                clients, employers and other developers what’s happening in their lives and in the cases 
                of Jen Simmons and Rachel Andrew, new standards of CSS.
