        <h1>Performance and Optimisation</h1>

        <div class="main-content">
            <section class="code">
                <div class="blog-paragraph">
                    <h2>Code</h2>
                    <p><span class="paragraph-one__dropcap"> W </span>hen making this portfolio site, 
                        I used all the code taught to me over the past 3 years as semantically correct 
                        as possible making sure all the elements expected to be there, are actually there. 
                        As stated in my second blog post I’m not using divs to create a navigation as, 
                        due to the wonders of HTML5, we have a dedicated tag for that.
                    </p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="blog-paragraph">
                    <p>
                    All images that provide context to the screen have an alt tag which provides a description 
                    of the image, that way. Sighted people aren’t the only ones looking at them. On the flip 
                    side if the images are throwaways and are just there to make the page look nice, they have a 
                    blank alt tag that way even assistive technologies know to pass them by.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>
            
            <section class="Optimisation">
                <div class="blog-paragraph">
                    <h2>Optimisation</h2>
                    <p>
                    In order to get to most out of those images I marked up lovingly i also optimised them. 
                    How you ask? Well I took them to tiny jpeg and pressed them down just a little bit more 
                    so they aren’t megabytes slowing down that precious internet speed and data. 
                    This also helps to increase page loading times. Don’t want people bouncing off the 
                    website before it’s even loaded now do we? At this point the highest size of image 
                    on this website is at around 350kb.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>


            <section class="seo">
                <div class="blog-paragraph">
                    <h2>SEO Integration</h2>
                    <p>
                    A lot goes into making a website appear in the top results of google due 
                    to the millions and millions of websites on the internet. 
                    During the construction of this site I had to pull out all the stops to make it 
                    climb those ranks.
                    </p>
                </div>
                       
               <div class="blog-paragraph">
                    <p>
                    The first being those all important meta tags in the head of the document. 
                    You won’t see them unless you go looking for them in the inspector or by viewing the 
                    source but the search engines sure look for them. I filled keywords so the browser 
                    can see what keywords I associate with. Author, so it knows I made it, and descriptions 
                    to make sure user’s get a nice preview before they even land on the page.
                    </p>
               </div>
                
                <div class="blog-paragraph">
                    <p>
                    Another stage I implemented onto the site to make sure I get the most out of that all 
                    important ranking is making sure the site contained buzzwords people are expecting to 
                    find when they think about me, my unique spelling of Addam for starters. 
                    It helps with something. Even if there was another Addam, who was also a front-end 
                    developer ALSO living in manchester the chances they also have my surname, 
                    also listed as the first thing you see when you reach the homepage, are quite low so 
                    again all these buzzwords help when it comes to climbing the ranks of the internet.
                    </p>
                </div>
            
                <div class="blog-paragraph">
                    <p>
                    If I’m honest the things I have done to maximise the SEO integration probably 
                    doesn’t even scratch the surface of the potential I could have had but then I don’t 
                    think even google could master that one, not to say I’m not going to try and improve it, 
                    because I’m absolutely going to.
                    </p>
                </div>
                    
                <div class="blog-paragraph">
                    <p>
                    On the whole optimisations seems to be going well with performance of the 
                    site being at 100 according to google’s audit. Other ranks include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>100 - Accessibility</li>
                            <li>87 - Best Practices</li>
                            <li>100 - SEO</li>
                        </ul>
