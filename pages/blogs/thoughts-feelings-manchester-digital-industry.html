                <p><span class="paragraph-one__dropcap"> M </span>anchester’s Digital Industry is growing more and more by the second. 
                There are alot of jobs in a wide range of disciplines. I have looked at a few reports and sources following this discovery 
                and the following will look at how this impacts me as a Front-end dev.</p>
            </div>


        <section class="skills">
            <div class="blog-paragraph">

                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>
                One of the report’s focus points in relation to my field I have been astounded at the
                rate of expected growth for Developers as it is the expected to grow 20% according to 
                Manchester Digital’s Skills Audit (MDSA). This is supported by Technation’s 2018 report which 
                states “Between 2014 and 2017 employment in the digital tech sector increased by 13.2%.”  
                This means there is an abundant of jobs in the sector even allowing versatility in job applications, 
                possibly creating a competitive employment environment.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="blog-paragraph">
            <p>
            Of that growth in the sector the demand of JavaScript is very high, according to MDSA 32% of the 
            employers who had taken part in the audit are looking for developers in JavaScript. 
            Similarly Cathcart Associates found this similar demand in the language.
            </p>
            </div>


            <div class="blog-paragraph">
                <p>
                However none of the reports mention React in anyway yet the Manchester Digital audit 
                mentions another JavaScript library; Angular which leaves an ambiguous point on React as to 
                whether it is in demand or not, which from look at the alerts I have set myself up to receive 
                regarding newly posted Dev jobs, is on the rise yet but the report mentions Angular.
                </p>
            </div>

        <section class="opportunities">           
           <div class="blog-paragraph">
               <h2>Opportunities</h2>
                <p>
                Another point I would like to bring up from the MDSA is how many businesses are actively 
                recruiting graduates. According to the report the figure sits at 70%, meaning there is a gap in the
                industry for graduates to enter, meaning that graduates with plans to enter the digital sector 
                are more likely to secure a role. 
                </p>
           </div>
            
            <div class="blog-paragraph">
                <p>
                Furthering on from this statistic is 48% of businesses are even 
                running their own graduate scheme within the company. This allows for employers to take a freshly 
                graduated Developer for example, and shape them into the developer they want them to be. Not only 
                will this make sure that the jobs gap is filled up but will also provide a feeling of loyalty between 
                the graduate and the company, instilling a certain measure of trust between the two. If the graduate 
                feels they are being helped and guided by the business they are more likely to stay and thus creates 
                a valuable member of the team for the business.
                </p>
            </div>
            
           <div class="blog-paragraph">
                <p>
                However a statistic mentioned in the MDSA was only 13% of all 
                businesses asked to take part in the audit felt that the graduates 
                had the right soft skills and technical knowledge to be ready for the workplace. 
                Despite the graduate schemes in place the figure shows that student’s upon leaving are not in the 
                best position to start working at the expected level the business expects. If more businesses were 
                to talk to students and advise them on what they were looking for from their graduates the unit 
                modules could be changed to fit this need.

        <section class="conclusion">
            
            <h2>Closing thoughts:</h2>
            
            <div class="blog-paragraph">
                <p>
                With many employers looking at graduates in a highly competitive sector where the slightest 
                advantage can make all the difference it can be a very daunting sector to go into. Even now 
                talking to Junior Developers or past graduates can make me seem to stand head and 
                shoulders below their capabilities. This gives way to a feeling of impostor syndrome, this is 
                the feeling that a person has when they feel in their mind: “I don’t belong in this place.” Or 
                “I’m not good enough to be here.” These feelings can stand in the way of graduates and even students 
                engaging in the sector or other developers.
                </p>
            </div>
            

            <div class="blog-paragraph">
                <p>
                This feeling was touched upon by Christopher Murphy showing how it can impact anyone in 
                any role, regardless on level of expertise from novice or recent graduate to Senior roles. Christopher 
                even goes as far as to draw comparisons to a house of cards, which personally I can relate to. 
                Thinking that I’m one question away from the whole stack of cards falling down around me.
                </p>
            </div>

           <div class="blog-paragraph">
                <p>
                Despite this underlying feeling of self-dread. I am feeling very excited of the future, 
                I am happy with choosing to be a Front-end Dev, and I’m very happy to have chosen to 
                come home, to Manchester to do this.
